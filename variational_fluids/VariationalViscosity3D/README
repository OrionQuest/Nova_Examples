This is a barebones 3D fluid simulator for animating viscous free surface liquids.
It implements the variational viscosity method from "Accurate Viscous Free Surfaces for Buckling, 
Coiling, and Rotating Liquids" by Batty and Bridson, Symposium on Computer Animation, 2008.

The "viewpls3D" sub-project provides a simple viewer for the resulting data.
